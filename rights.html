    <h2>What are Miranda rights?</h2>
      <p>“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me?”</p>
      <p><div>Your right to silence in America are known as Miranda rights. 
      The purpose of Miranda rights are to keep statements made during interrogation admissible during later criminal proceedings and being protected from self-incrimination under the fifth amendment. 
      Before questioning can proceed the suspect must voluntarily waive their miranda rights.
      The waiving of Miranda rights must be clear. 
      If you waive your rights and change your mind during questioning you can ‘plead the fifth’ meaning no more questions have to be asked and you can have an attorney present. 
      If you don’t waive your rights and invoke your right to remain silent you are not required to speak during questioning and can ask for an attorney present. 
      If a minor is called into questioning the police don’t need parent consent but, parents can refuse for them to be questioned.</div></p>
    <h2>More rights</h2>
      <p><div>You can say no if police ask permission to search you or your things.</div></p>
