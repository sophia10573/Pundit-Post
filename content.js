"text":"Pundit Post is a place where all people can go in order to learn more about how America’s government \
works and what exactly happens behind the curtains. The world of the U.S. government can get confusing, so \
it is difficult to keep up with the whirling world of commotion. Luckily, we understand what that’s like.\
As the future \
generation, it is vital that we know what happens in our government so that we can have a voice to make any changes \
 that we wish to see. Yes, we can talk about the government and we have heard about all \
 of the news and the fancy vocabulary, but do we actually comprehend how everything operates? \
 This website includes everything you need to know about what is currently happening in the American\
  world of politics and what you can personally do to be involved. Here, you can learn about what exactly is our\
   government and all of the branches that hold it up to make it work the way it does. You can also learn about \
   the roles of the American people on our How-To page, containing topics such as how to vote, protests and voting your \
   opinion out in the public, and more safe ways to be involved. We want you to understand what people are talking about \
   when the subject of politics is brought up, so we even have a vocab page - just because you actually \
   want to master the terms you’re using. We also have an interactive map in which you can see each state’s\
    representatives and laws so that you can learn more about each state’s happenings. To show off what you\
     can use to speak your mind, we even include a fun page where you can see awesome art and signs that were seen at protests and other gatherings. A crucial part of our mission is to spread the news that is coming everywhere from different parts of the world. We have a news page where you can know what is \
     currently going on in the world - locally and globally. We believe that in order to make a change you should see other changes first in order to make an impact. It is essential to learn more about the relationships between the U.S. and other countries and how things that change the world also influence the U.S. and it what ways.News is one of our main focuses because we want others to be informed and inspired to make a change for all of the good and evil seen within the country. Most importantly, we want you to understand why you should care. A change cannot be seen if you do not care about what you are trying to impact. We want you to promote your change in your own unique voice, which is why we have a Why You Should Care page on our website. The future will only change in your favor if you do what is seen as just and right. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."

"text": "What Is Our Government?\
What is the type of government of the USA? How is it organized? How does it actually function?\
If you've ever found yourself asking these questions, you're on the right page! Form The United States' form of government is quite unique, and many people often struggle to accurately label for it. It encorporates aspects from both a republican form of government as well as a democracy. As citizens, we can vote for representitives who will then make our laws and control our government, making us a representative republic. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a democracy as government by the people; especially : rule of the majority, meaning that the United States is also a democracy, because every citizen is allowed to vote and participate in free elections; however, we are not a direct democracy, in which decisions and laws are made by popular vote only (without representatives). In addition, the U.S. has a document, known as the United States Constitution, that represents the supreme law\
of the nation. Combine all of these factors and forms, and you end up with a constitutional, democratic republic.\
Politics The United States has mainly a two-party system, the major ones being the Democratic and Republican parties. \
There also exist third parties, such as the Libertarian Party and the Green Party; however, these parties are rarely able to receive many votes or gain representation.Branches In the federal government, there exist three branches which each have separate powers, roles, and limitations, as described in the Constitution. A system of checks and balances ensures that no branch can assume too much responsibility or wield an excessive amount of power in the government. For example, the Executive Branch can veto bills from the Legislative Branch, but the Legislative Branch can override the veto. Judicial Branch The Judicial Branch is the system of federal courts and judges of the U.S. government. Its role is to interpret laws made by the legislative branch. Many decisions are made by the nine justices of the Supreme Court, the highest court in the United States. One of its most important duties is referred to as Judicial Review.\
This is a process of analysis where the Supreme Court decides whether a law is constitutional or not. If the law is found to be in conflict with the Constitution, it can be declared null and void. Judicial Review makes the Judicial branch the final arbiter of the constitution when it comes to federal or state laws, executive orders and lower court rulings. All federal judges are nominated by the sitting U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate. They are appointed for life, in order to ensure\
independence and avoid outside pressures. Their removal is possible only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. There are nine Supreme Court justicies, thirteen appellate courts (U.S. Courts of Appeals), and 94 federal judicial districts organized into 12 regional circuits, each of which has its own court of appeals. The 13th court is known as the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is located in Washington, D.C.. Legislative Branch The Legislative Branch, also known as Congress, is mainly responsible for making laws. Other responsibilities include confirming or rejecting Presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court, and declaring war. The branch includes two sections, the Senate and the House of Representatives. American citizens have the right to vote for Senators and Representatives through free, confidential ballots.\
Senate — Each state has two elected Senators, totaling to 100 senators in the U.S.. \
A senator serves for six years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve. \
House of Representatives —There are 435 elected Representatives total in the United States, which are divided among the 50 states in proportion to their population size. \
There are additional non-voting delegates who represent the District of Columbia and the territories. \
A Representative serves a two-year term, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve. Executive Branch The Executive Branch carries out and enforces laws. It includes the President, Vice President, the Cabinet, executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.\
American citizens have the right to vote for the President and Vice President through free, confidential ballots. President —The President is the leader of the country. He or she is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States Armed Forces.\
The President serves a four-year term and can be elected no more than two times. Vice President —The Vice President supports the President. If the President is unable to serve, the Vice President becomes President. \
The Vice President can be elected and serve an unlimited number of four-year terms as Vice President, even under a different President.The Cabinet —Cabinet members serve as advisors to the President. They include the Vice President, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the President and must be approved by a simple majority of the Senate."

"text":"History of the 2 party system The election of 1796 was the first election in American history where political candidates of the local, state, and national level ran for office as members of organized political parties that had \
 strongly opposed political principles. The two parties were known as Federalists, who supported the federal administration, \
  and Democratic-Republicans, who were committed to extending the revolution to ordinary people. Federalists thought of each other as “friends of order” and good government and believed the Democratic-Republicans \
  were radicals. Democratic-Republicans thought of themselves as supporters of equal-rights, independence, and free elective government and believed Federalists were aristocrats laying the foundations to monarchical government. The United States has had 5 party systems(possibly 6): Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans Democratic-Republicans split and became modern Democrats in support of Andrew Jackson and National Republicans in support of John Quincy Adams. Democrats had a strong and loyal supporters in the south. Republicans had the dominant faction. Republicans were dominant but Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Grover Cleveland were elected two terms.(Progressive Era) Democrats mostly had control of the presidencies.(New Deal Party System) Experts debate whether we are currently in the sixth party system. Between 1860 and 1936 the parties switched platforms."

"text":"What are Miranda rights? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. \
You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? \
With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me? Your right to silence in America are known as Miranda rights. The purpose of Miranda rights are to keep statements made during interrogation admissible during later criminal proceedings and being protected from \
self-incrimination under the fifth amendment. Before questioning can proceed the suspect must voluntarily waive their miranda rights. The waiving of Miranda rights must be clear. If you waive your \
rights and change your mind during questioning you can ‘plead the fifth’ meaning no more questions have to be asked and you can have an attorney present. If you don’t waive your rights and invoke your right to remain silent\
 you are not required to speak during questioning and can ask for an attorney present. If a minor is called into questioning the police don’t need parent consent but, parents can refuse for them to be questioned. More rights \
 You can say no if police ask permission to search you or your things. You can leave unless being detained or arrested. If being arrested or detained you have a right to know why and speak privately to a lawyer. \
 You can only be strip searched by officers in private of the same sex. You have a right to know an officers name and badge number. You can report officers who abuse you, swear at you, or violate your rights."

"text":"News Bias, Fake News, and Satire Nowadays it is so difficult to find credible, unbiased news. The current divide between the Democratic and Republican parties has led to more blatant bias in news than ever before. \
It is important to understand that because journalists are people with opinions, just like us, these opinions can show through in the news that sources choose to broadcast and the way in which they broadcast it. One event can be covered by two news sources with drastically different points of view. A way to combat bias in credible news sources is to compare multiple sources to one another and the information that overlaps is the most factual. \
Just as bias in news makes it less reliable, there are many websites that spout what has been coined as Fake News. The intention of Fake News sources is to mislead the public. Fake News sources are much easier to spot once you're aware that they exist. You should always check the information that you read with other sources to check its authenticity. A common mistake that is made when reading news sources is mistaking satiric news as factual. Satiric news sources include websites like The Onion and ClickHole. Reliable Sources The below image shows a good representation of biases in specific well-known news sources and how harmful the bias of each source is to the public"
