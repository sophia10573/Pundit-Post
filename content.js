"text":"Pundit Post is a place where all people can go in order to learn more about how America’s government \
works and what exactly happens behind the curtains. The world of the U.S. government can get confusing, so \
it is difficult to keep up with the whirling world of commotion. Luckily, we understand what that’s like.\
As the future \
generation, it is vital that we know what happens in our government so that we can have a voice to make any changes \
 that we wish to see. Yes, we can talk about the government and we have heard about all \
 of the news and the fancy vocabulary, but do we actually comprehend how everything operates? \
 This website includes everything you need to know about what is currently happening in the American\
  world of politics and what you can personally do to be involved. Here, you can learn about what exactly is our\
   government and all of the branches that hold it up to make it work the way it does. You can also learn about \
   the roles of the American people on our How-To page, containing topics such as how to vote, protests and voting your \
   opinion out in the public, and more safe ways to be involved. We want you to understand what people are talking about \
   when the subject of politics is brought up, so we even have a vocab page - just because you actually \
   want to master the terms you’re using. We also have an interactive map in which you can see each state’s\
    representatives and laws so that you can learn more about each state’s happenings. To show off what you\
     can use to speak your mind, we even include a fun page where you can see awesome art and signs that were seen at protests and other gatherings. A crucial part of our mission is to spread the news that is coming everywhere from different parts of the world. We have a news page where you can know what is \
     currently going on in the world - locally and globally. We believe that in order to make a change you should see other changes first in order to make an impact. It is essential to learn more about the relationships between the U.S. and other countries and how things that change the world also influence the U.S. and it what ways.News is one of our main focuses because we want others to be informed and inspired to make a change for all of the good and evil seen within the country. Most importantly, we want you to understand why you should care. A change cannot be seen if you do not care about what you are trying to impact. We want you to promote your change in your own unique voice, which is why we have a Why You Should Care page on our website. The future will only change in your favor if you do what is seen as just and right. As Eleanor Roosevelt once said, The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."

"text":"History of the 2 party system The election of 1796 was the first election in American history where political candidates of the local, state, and national level ran for office as members of organized political parties that had \
 strongly opposed political principles. The two parties were known as Federalists, who supported the federal administration, \
  and Democratic-Republicans, who were committed to extending the revolution to ordinary people. Federalists thought of each other as “friends of order” and good government and believed the Democratic-Republicans \
  were radicals. Democratic-Republicans thought of themselves as supporters of equal-rights, independence, and free elective government and believed Federalists were aristocrats laying the foundations to monarchical government. The United States has had 5 party systems(possibly 6): Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans Democratic-Republicans split and became modern Democrats in support of Andrew Jackson and National Republicans in support of John Quincy Adams. Democrats had a strong and loyal supporters in the south. Republicans had the dominant faction. Republicans were dominant but Democrats Woodrow Wilson and Grover Cleveland were elected two terms.(Progressive Era) Democrats mostly had control of the presidencies.(New Deal Party System) Experts debate whether we are currently in the sixth party system. Between 1860 and 1936 the parties switched platforms."

"text":"What are Miranda rights? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. \
You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand the rights I have just read to you? \
With these rights in mind, do you wish to speak to me? Your right to silence in America are known as Miranda rights. The purpose of Miranda rights are to keep statements made during interrogation admissible during later criminal proceedings and being protected from \
self-incrimination under the fifth amendment. Before questioning can proceed the suspect must voluntarily waive their miranda rights. The waiving of Miranda rights must be clear. If you waive your \
rights and change your mind during questioning you can ‘plead the fifth’ meaning no more questions have to be asked and you can have an attorney present. If you don’t waive your rights and invoke your right to remain silent\
 you are not required to speak during questioning and can ask for an attorney present. If a minor is called into questioning the police don’t need parent consent but, parents can refuse for them to be questioned. More rights \
 You can say no if police ask permission to search you or your things. You can leave unless being detained or arrested. If being arrested or detained you have a right to know why and speak privately to a lawyer. \
 You can only be strip searched by officers in private of the same sex. You have a right to know an officers name and badge number. You can report officers who abuse you, swear at you, or violate your rights."
