  <h2 id="sec_title">Form</h2>
  <div id="branches"> The United States' form of government is quite unique, and many people often struggle to accurately label for it. It encorporates aspects from both a republican form of government as well as a democracy. As citizens, we can vote for representitives who will then make our laws and control our government, making us a representative republic. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a democracy
    as "government by the people; especially : rule of the majority," meaning that the United States is also a democracy, because every citizen is allowed to vote and participate in free elections; however, we are not a direct democracy, in which decisions and laws are made by popular vote only (without representatives). In addition, the U.S. has a document, known as the United States Constitution, that represents the "supreme law" of the nation. Combine
    all of these factors and forms, and you end up with a <strong> constitutional, democratic republic</strong>. <br>

  <h2 id="sec_title">Branches</h2>
  <div id="branches">In the federal government, there exist three branches which each have separate powers, roles, and limitations, as described in the Constitution. A system of "checks and balances" ensures that no branch can assume too much responsibility or wield an excessive amount of power in the government. For example, the Executive Branch can veto bills from the Legislative Branch, but the Legislative Branch can override the veto.</div>

  <div class="column" style="background-color:#99ceff;">
    <h2 id="branchtitle">Judicial Branch</h2>
    <p id="branches">The Judicial Branch is the system of federal courts and judges of the U.S. government. Its role is to interpret laws made by the legislative branch. Many decisions are made by the nine justices of the Supreme Court, the highest court in the United States.
      One of its most important duties is referred to as "Judicial Review." This is a process of analysis where the Supreme Court decides whether a law is constitutional or not. If the law is found to be in conflict with the Constitution, it can be declared null and void. Judicial Review makes the Judicial branch the final arbiter of the constitution when it comes to federal or state laws, executive orders and lower court rulings.
      All federal judges are nominated by the sitting U.S. president and confirmed by the Senate. They are appointed for life, in order to ensure independence and avoid outside pressures. Their removal is possible only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate.
      There are nine Supreme Court justicies, thirteen appellate courts (U.S. Courts of Appeals), and 94 federal judicial districts organized into 12 regional circuits, each of which has its own court of appeals. The 13th court is known as the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and is located in Washington, D.C..</p>

    <h2 id="branchtitle">Legislative Branch</h2>
    <p id="branches">The Legislative Branch, also known as Congress, is mainly responsible for making laws. Other responsibilities include confirming or rejecting Presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court, and declaring war.
      The branch includes two sections, the Senate and the House of Representatives. American citizens have the right to vote for Senators and Representatives through free, confidential ballots.
      <br><br>
      <strong>Senate </strong>â€” Each state has two elected Senators, totaling to 100 senators in the U.S.. A senator serves for six years, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.
      <br><br>
      <strong>House of Representatives </strong>â€”There are 435 elected Representatives total in the United States, which are divided among the 50 states in proportion to their population size. There are additional non-voting delegates who represent the District of Columbia and the territories. A Representative serves a two-year term, and there is no limit to the number of terms an individual can serve.<br><br>
