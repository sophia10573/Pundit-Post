   <h2>Bias, Fake News, and Satire</h2>
    <img id="bias" src="bias.jpg">
    <div id = "newstext">
    <p>Nowadays it is so difficult to find credible, unbiased news. The current divide between the Democratic and Republican parties has led to more blatant bias in news than ever before. It is
    important to understand that because journalists are people with opinions, just like us, these opinions can show through in the news that sources choose
    to broadcast and the way in which they broadcast it. One event can be covered by two news sources with drastically different points of view. A way to combat bias
    in credible news sources is to compare multiple sources to one another and the information that overlaps is the most factual. </p>
  </div>
    <div id = "newstext">
    <p>Just as bias in news makes it less reliable, there are many websites that spout what has been coined as "Fake News". The intention of "Fake News" sources
    is to mislead the public. "Fake News" sources are much easier to spot once you're aware that they exist. You should always check the information that you read with other sources to check
    its authenticity. A common mistake that is made when reading news sources is mistaking satiric news as factual. Satiric news sources include websites like The Onion and ClickHole.</p>
