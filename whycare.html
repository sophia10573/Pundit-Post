 <h1> Why You Should Care </h1>
 <h2> You have sat by the sidelines and watched everything unfold. You have watched the TV and only saw what was happening in the world by looking at a screen. So how do you relate all of that to your own life? How do you understand why you should care? It seems like none of this really matters, but in the end, it affects everything you know. How you act upon what you see can change your life and it can also change the world. 
 <br>
 <h2> 1.) </h2>
 <p> The government controls every aspect of our lives, believe it or not. There isn’t one part of your day that isn’t impacted by some rule of the government. Ranging from taxes to what you use on your phone, there is a lot more effort from the government that goes into everything than you would think. Since everything impacts you, this should only motivate you to discover what is best for you and your family and friends when it comes to making decisions that can be government affiliated. 
 </p>
 <br>
 <h2> 2.) </h2>
 <p> Being more informed can help you in the long run. The more you pay attention to news or even social media and protests, you will know more about what leaders are doing and how people feel about it. If those people believe in the same values as you, it is likely you will feel the same way about the leader as well. So much representation of a potential leader is displayed through the media and it is easy to capture what you envision in a future leader when you pay closer attention to the news. That’s why it’s important to do some of your own independent research as well. This will only help you understand why you should vote for what and how it can be a benefit to your own life in the future. 
 </p>
 <br>
 <h2> 3.) </h2> 
 <p>  In the end, you only end up learning more about yourself. Who you believe makes a good leader for your country and who you follow reflects a lot about your personality and what you believe. Discovering more about what you believe in can help you develop into a more confident person that is willing to stand up for what they believe in. If you feel like you are being oppressed or your minority is not being represented enough, this is your chance to speak your mind for what is right. When you fight for what you believe is right, that is the moment that change in the world is made.
